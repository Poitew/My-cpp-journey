# My-cpp-journey
I created this repository to keep track of my progress, I'll post everything I made and that I'll make from now on, I'll also add my personal miro board where I wrote everything I know with some description.

Here is the link for the miro board.

Even thought I'm not uploading any project, I am still training and learning new things every day.
