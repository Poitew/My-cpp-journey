# My-cpp-journey
I created this repository to keep track of my progress, I'll post everything I made and that I'll make from now on, I'll also add my personal miro board where I wrote everything I know with some description.

Here is the link for the miro board, I hope it nevere expires.

basics things are missing, like namespaces, library, variables, just assume that I forgot about it or just that I didn't feel like it needed to be written.
